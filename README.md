Description<br/>
Coursework (Checkpoints) <br/><br/>

Programming<br/>
CP01: Python program to calculate and print to the terminal the radius and surface area of a sphere from its volume <br/><br/>
CP02: Python program to read in the three floating point coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ then calculate and display the roots using the standard formula for roots of quadratic being, $ri={−b±sqrt(b−4ac)}/(2a)$<br/><br/>
CP03: Python program to explore the behaviour of a damped simple harmonic oscillator for a range of damping coefficients <br/><br/>
CP04: Python program to read in data from a text file in a specified format, perform some simple processing and display the output using pyplot<br/><br/>
CP05: Python program to numerically analyse the path of a projectile under gravity and drag force. There are two tasks, one to display the trajectory and the second to display the relation between final kinetic energy and launch angle <br/><br/>

Data Analysis(LibreOffice)<br/>
CP02: Using given measurements, construct the spreadsheet to determine the spring constant of a spring by timing the oscillations of a various masses fixed to the end of it.<br/><br/>
CP03: Using given measurements, determine the average decay rate(in counts/sec), and its uncertainty.<br/><br/>
CP04.1: Using given measurements, first linearise the equation of a simple harmonic motion with the period $T$, and plot a graph showing the linearised data and the appropriate uncertainties.<br/><br/>
CP04.2: Using given measurements, first linearise the equation of a relationship between the resistance $R$ of silicon and temperature $T$, and plot a graph showing the linearised data and the appropriate uncertainties.<br/><br/>
CP05.1: Using LINEST, <br/>
(i) Linearise data from CP04.1, and hence determine a value and uncertainty for $g$.<br/>
(ii) Plot a graph showing the linearised data, the uncertainties and the best-fitting straight line.<br/>
(iii) From a plot of the residuals of the linear fit, comment on the quality of the data, and the appropriateness of the uncertainties.<br/><br/>
CP05.2: Using LINEST, <br/>
(i) Linearised data from CP04.2, and hence determine the value and uncertainty of $Eg$ in unit $eV$.<br/>
(ii) From the same least-squares fit, determine the value and uncertainty of $R0$ in ohms.<br/>
(iii) Plot a graph showing the linearised data, the uncertainties and the best-fitting straight line.<br/>
(iv) Plot a second graph of the residuals of the linear fit<br/><br/>
CP06: Using LINEST, <br/>
(i) Determine the experimental values (and uncertainties) of $a$ and $df$ when mashing squares of aluminium foil with sides of length $L$ into spheres of radius $r$.<br/>
(ii) Plot the residuals from your linear fit.
