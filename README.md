PHYS08049 Programming and Data Analysis Coursework

Description
Coursework (Checkpoints)
CP01: Python program to calculate and print to the terminal the radius and surface area of a sphere from its volume
CP02: Python program to read in the three floating point coefficients a, b, and c of the quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0 then calculate and display the roots using the standard formula for roots of quadratic being, ri={−b±sqrt(b−4ac)}/(2a)
CP03: Python program to explore the behaviour of a damped simple harmonic oscillator for a range of damping coefficients
CP04: Python program to read in data from a text file in a specified format, perform some simple processing and display the output using pyplot
CP05: Python programs to numerically analyse the path of a projectile under gravity and drag force. There are two tasks, one to display the trajectory and the second to display the relation between final kinetic energy and launch angle
